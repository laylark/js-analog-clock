# [Analog Clock](https://laylark.github.io/js-analog-clock/)

This repo is my analog clock in JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this analog clock is to enhance my understanding of the Date() object and the setInterval method. This project was completed and added upon after following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbe2hn4W3z0).
